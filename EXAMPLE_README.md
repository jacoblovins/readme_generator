## Description

This is an app that takes in information from the user about their project, formats that information, and creates a well structured, professional README file. Save time on creating your readme file by just answering some questions. No more researching markdown or worrying about what goes where and how to access it. This app does it for you. Just grab your newly generated README and drag it into your main project folder. This app utilizes node.js, modules, async await, inquirer, fs, and more.
